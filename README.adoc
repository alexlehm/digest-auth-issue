= digest auth issue reproducer

Please download the cli distribution from monero, we will only use monero-wallet-rpc

https://getmonero.org/downloads/

Start the rpc server with the command

     ./monero-wallet-rpc --rpc-bind-port 18082 --rpc-login username:password --wallet-dir wallet

When accessing the rpc server with curl, the login works

     curl -v --user username:password --digest http://localhost:18082/json_rpc

but when using a WebClient connection with vert.x it fails.

The most part of the project is from Vincent from this thread https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vertx/6QIdpO3ScLw/HBXHGuttAQAJ
I just added the necessary parameters to test it against the localhost server.

I am not able to figure out why this fails, this may be a bug in the rpc server code,
however when running digest auth against an apache 2.4 server, the auth works
with the vert.x code.
